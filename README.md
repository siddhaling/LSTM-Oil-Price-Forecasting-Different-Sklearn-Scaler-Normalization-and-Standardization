LSTM Oil Price Forecasting Different Sklearn Scaler Normalization and Standardization
Python code to perform oil price forecasting. This is an univariate model.

***********************************************************************************************************************
This is a python code to Oil Price Forecasting Different Sklearn Scaler Normalization and Standardization
***********************************************************************************************************************

Package Version\
python 3.6.8\
pandas 0.24.1\
Keras 2.2.4\
skimage 0.24

This python demonstrates the univariate oil price forecasting using LSTM deep learning model\
The sliding window is used to creating training and validation in the time series data\
Two different scalers provided by Sklearn are used: Normalization and Standardization\
Both the time the forecasted and actual oil prices are plotted to visualize the impact of different scaler technique\
